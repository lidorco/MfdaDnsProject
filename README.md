# MfdaDnsProject
Methods for detecting attacks DNS Project is a machine learning exercise in Methods for detecting attacks course delivered at Ben Gurion University. 
### The Exercise
In this exercise we get DNS network traffic from 15 diffrent users, and we split the data to chunks. We need to use machine learning technique to learn which chunk releated to which user. The goal is to successfully identify the user, upon random chunk.
